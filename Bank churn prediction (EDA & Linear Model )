Bank Churn Prediction - EDA & Logistic Regression

Overview

This project involves an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a bank customer dataset to understand the factors influencing customer churn. After the analysis, a Logistic Regression Model is built to predict churn probabilities.

Dataset

The dataset contains various customer attributes, including:

Demographics: Age, gender, number of dependents, etc.

Account Information: Account balance, tenure, number of products, etc.

Behavioral Indicators: Transaction history, last transaction date, etc.

Churn Status: Whether the customer churned (1) or remained (0).

Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values (e.g., dependent and city columns)

Feature engineering (extracting date-based features)

Encoding categorical variables

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Univariate and Bivariate analysis

Churn rate distribution

Correlation heatmaps & feature importance

Customer segmentation based on behavior

Model Building - Logistic Regression:

Train-test split (e.g., 80-20 ratio)

Feature scaling (Standardization)

Model training and evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC

Results & Insights

Key drivers of churn include tenure, number of products, and account balance.

Customers with multiple products and higher engagement are less likely to churn.

The Logistic Regression model achieves a good balance of precision and recall.

Technologies Used

Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook
